    **Public Interest Technology (PIT)** is a movement at the intersection of **technology, ethics, and social good**.  
    It is about designing, developing, and applying technology in ways that **advance equity, justice, and democracy** — ensuring that innovation serves people, not just profit.  
    
    PIT practitioners come from all backgrounds — computer science, policy, law, social sciences, design — working together to solve real-world problems like:
    - Building responsible and fair AI systems  
    - Enhancing digital privacy and trust  
    - Ensuring access and accessibility in technology  
    - Protecting democracy from digital threats
